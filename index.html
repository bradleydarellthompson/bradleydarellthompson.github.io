            <p>
                As a passionate and eager Computer Science graduate, I have hands-on experience
                developing applications using C++/C#, HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, and several other
                languages. I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, and I love
                tackling new challenges. My goal is to create efficient and
                scalable applications that provide an excellent user experience.
